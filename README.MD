This is a pack heavily based on my previous pack "Galaxy Gaming - Engineering". I decided to port/revamp it into a skyblock pack with quests.

This pack is different from other skyblock packs because of a few things.

- First and foremost it heavily uses Reskillable and CompatSkills to stage/lock items and progression.

- Secondly, this modpack does not include ex nihilo, (it also does not include sky resources). Instead for resource generation different hostile mobs drop the various ores based on your skills' levels in Reskillable. For example, a few mobs can drop coal but only once you reach mining 3 and gathering 3.

- Thirdly, there are no cobblestone generators at all. You start out by sneak right clicking dirt to get pebbles which you hand in as cobblestone in your first quest (can be seen in images tab). The reward for this quest is a Transmutation Table. Thanks to Reskillable and CompatSkills I am able to stage transmutation so even though you start the pack off with a Transmutation Table... all you can use it for is to create simple items. You can use items like diamonds as EMC to produce more cobblestone but you will need to progress further before being able to turn cobble back into diamonds. Early on you use wood from trees to produce EMC and get more cobblestone. 


A large part of the modpack is designed around automating EMC generation. I have revamped how mystical agriculture works and I use it as the base for my EMC farming implementation. I have created various recipes to get from one tier of seed to the next, as well as, recipes to get from essence to usable EMC. (The final tier of EMC seeds produces 863,596,339,200,000 EMC per essence)

Unlike the original pack (Engineering), I have took it upon myself to add quests (as of the latest version there are 283 quests). Some of the quests are not phrased the best but they are mainly there to help guide you along progression and give you some goals. There are no loot bag rewards in fact the majority of rewards are just levels of experience that can be used for leveling up whatever skills you wish to level.

The majority of armor and tools are focused around tinker's construct; however, this is where GG Skyblock varies even more from other well known packs. Almost all the materials and traits have individual locks on them so each tool combination has its own unique set of requirements to use. This means you have to slowly upgrade your tool overtime and can't just go for that "best" combo you are used to, and instead have to keep figuring out what is the best tool you can use at any time. Given your skills are always changing allowing you to use more advanced items.
