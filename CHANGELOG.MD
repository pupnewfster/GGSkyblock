# Changelog

### 1.3
- Changed max stack size of clay bucket back to 16 as collecting rain update fixed the bug.
- Removed EMC values from Tech Reborn's Small Pile of Dust items. For the same reason as diamond nuggets were removed last update.
- Added a few more tips
- Added a chance of the orechid turning stone into sand. This was done to lower the rate at which aquamarine is made.
- Changed the recipe of the Orechid to make diamonds not a prerequisite of Astral Sorcery

Updated
  - CollectingRain (1.0.4 to 1.0.5)



### 1.2 (BETA)
- Added a little bit more information to some quests.
- Moved metallurgic infuser quest earlier, given it is needed to make an empowerer.
- Made the drawer controller not require a diamond. (It now requires an iron ingot instead).
- Added a quest for making a drawer controller.
- Made villagers drop experience
- Looting 3 now has guaranteed drop rate of resources.
- Added a quest about curing and breeding villagers.
- Re-enabled Actually Addition's farmer as an earlier game alternative to Ender IO's farming station.
- Locked some outputs of EMC farming behind the proper Thaumcraft research. (Can still be used for EMC, just can't be learned if not already known).
- More refactoring of some of the emc generation scripts
- Removed iron ore from Villager drop table. This increases the chance of diamonds significantly.
- Also adjusted the rates of the different drops from Villagers slightly.
- Ignore lens NBT for mana lens quest. Should allow any mana lens to now count. (Also fixes it being unclaimable without emc'ing a mana lens)
- Made Thaumonomicon quest clearer about the prereqs.
- Custom enriched compressed items now follow the default efficiency boost of 8 times instead of being 9 times
- Re-enabled `/island home` because apparently you can use `/island spawn` and then be stuck there.
- This update will say there is a missing registry entry from InWorldCrafting. That is due to an internal change in their code making it no longer needed. The registry entry removal should be able to be safely confirmed as removed.
- Temporarily disable the ability to use the personal link from Project EX until it can no longer be used as a way to bypass creation locks.
- Removed EMC value from spawn egg. It had one due to a thaumcraft recipe but it uses NBT so EMC wouldn't work with it anyways.
- Make Ceramics Empty Clay Bucket max stack size 1, as a countermeasure to dupe bugs
- Remove Diamond Nuggets as they allow EMC'ing diamonds a lot earlier than you are meant to be able to.
- Added EMC Seed and Essence recipes for tiers 31 through 35
